 britain.92.t:0 "알바니아의 연합국 가입 요청"
 britain.92.d:0 "알바니아 외교관들이 연합국 가입 요청을 보냈습니다. 알바니아는 민주주의 국가로서, 파시즘과 공산주의의 위협으로부터 우리와 함께 버티고 싶어합니다. 또한, 민주주의의 지도국으로서 우리는 다른 국가를 인도하고 민주주의의 참된 예시가 될 필요가 있습니다."
 
 albania.1.t:0 "이탈리아 문제"
 albania.1.d:0 "우리가 이탈리아에 심어 둔 스파이와 외교관들이 이탈리아 군 상층부가 작성한 알바니아 침공 계획을 발견했다고 경고했스니다. 이탈리아와 알바니아는 매우 친근한 관계를 유지하고 있고, 고도의 군사 및 경제 협력을 진행한다는 점에서, 알바니아 정부는 큰 충격에 빠졌습니다. 현재의 우리로는 침공을 막아낼 가능성이 희박합니다. 우리나라를 재무장시키고 최대한 빨리 전쟁에 대비해야 합니다!"
 albania.1.a:0 "저주받을 이탈리아 놈들!"
 albania.2.t:0 "두러스 회담"
 albania.2.d:0 "무솔리니와 이탈리아 정부는 알바니아의 두러스에서의 회담 개최에 동의했습니다. 우리가 자신들의 침공 계획을 알고 있다는 것을 들었을 때는 놀라는 눈치였지만, 우리에게 화를 내지는 않았습니다. 자신들의 요구를 제시함으로서 회담은 시작되었는데, 그 요구는 바로, 알바니아의 외교권을 완벽히 장악하고, 알바니아 어린이들을 이탈리아 사람이 가르치는 것이었으며, 그 대가로 경제 통제권은 완벽히 보장하며 외부 위협으로부터 보호를 약속했습니다. 이 조건은 침공 계획을 실행할 수 있게끔 방치해 두는 것보다는 나을 것입니다. 그렇게 된다면 완전 병합 말고는 선택지가 없겠죠. 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까요?"
 albania.2.a:0 "조건을 받아들입시다."
 albania.2.b:0 "굴복은 거부하지만 이탈리아 침략자들에게 경제의 일부를 내어줄 생각은 있습니다."
 albania.3.t:0 "회담 성공"
 albania.3.d:0 "이탈리아와의 회담이 성공적으로 끝났습니다!"
 albania.3.a:0 "좋습니다!"
 albania.4.t:0 "체타 에 페저스 서기장 선거"
 albania.4.d:0 "쿠데타가 성공하여 이제 정부를 통제하고 있습니다. 봉기군의 지도자 뮈슬림 페자가 알바니아의 대통령이 될 가능성이 높아 보였지만, 최근까지 파리에 있었던 호자의 인기가 갈수록 높아지고 있습니다. 호자의 웅변 능력은 절대 과소평가할 수 없습니다. 당 지도부는 누가 국가를 이끌어나갈지 투표로 결정하기로 했습니다."
 albania.4.a:0 "페자와 함께 갑시다!"
 albania.4.b:0 "호자가 더 낫습니다!"
 albania.5.t:0 "호자의 참호"
 albania.5.d:0 "오늘 호자는 공산당 지도자와 기자들에게 국가 전체에 참호를 건설한다는 놀라운 계획을 발표했습니다. 호자는 공식적으로는 참호가 외부 위협으로부터 우리나라를 지키기 위한 것이라며, 서방 국가들의 위험성에 대해 경고했습니다. 하지만 당 지도부는 전부 이 참호들이 프로파간다의 중요한 역할을 맡을 것임을 알고 있습니다. 사람들의 공포를 사람들을 통제하는 데 사용할 수 있습니다. 참호 약 17만 3천 개가 지어질 예정입니다."
 albania.5.a:0 "호자가 우리를 보호하리라!"
 albania.5.b:0 "우리 경제는 그 정도 지출을 감당할 수 없습니다."
 albania.6.t:0 "외국 투자자 회담"
 albania.6.d:0 "정부는 우리나라의 잠재적 투자 이익에 대해 논의하기 위해 다양한 국가의 투자자들을 초청했습니다. 하지만 두 나라의 투자자들은 서로 상대방과 알바니아의 교역을 원치 않습니다. 이탈리아 투자자들은 프랑스와 우리의 교역에 불만을 가지고 있고, 만약 프랑스와의 무역을 멈추지 않으면 우리와의 교역을 줄이겠다고 엄포를 놓았습니다. 어떻게 해야 할까요?"
 albania.6.a:0 "이탈리아와 우리를 엮는 것이 나을 것입니다."
 albania.6.b:0 "저주받을 이탈리아! 우리는 프랑스랑 함께 간다!"
 albania.7.t:0 "밀라노 조약"
 albania.7.d:0 "알바니아 정부와 무솔리니는 마지막 조약 협상에 서명했습니다. 우리는 이탈리아와의 외교적인 총력전을 피할 수 있게 되었습니다. 우리나라 사람들도 자신들을 죽음으로 내몰지 않게 되었다는 점에서 기뻐하고 있습니다. 자랑스러워해도 좋습니다! (참고: 이탈리아는 더 이상 알바니아를 중점으로 공격할 수 없습니다. 중점 "알바니아 침공"이 비활성화됩니다.) "
 albania.7.a:0 "좋습니다!"
 albania.8.t:0 "1936년 알바니아 왕국의 상황"
 albania.8.d:0 "우리 왕국은 현재 최악의 상황에 놓여 있습니다. 1929년 경제 대공황은 경제를 파탄 상태로 몰아넣어 이탈리아에 의존하게끔 되었습니다. 이탈리아의 경제적 투자 및 교육과 정치계에서의 이탈리아인 존재로 인한 영향이 예상했던 것보다 더 컸기 때문에 날이 갈수록 간섭이 늘어가고 있습니다. 유럽의 긴장도가 커져감에 따라, 경제적 상황 개선과 이탈리아로부터의 완전한 독립 주장이 최고 우선이 되어야 할 것입니다. 그리스나 유고슬라비아 등 이웃과의 관계 개선도 빼놓을 수 없습니다. 또한 군대 확장을 통한다면 우리가 아드리아해 지역의 강대국이 될 수 있습니다. 위대한 지도자가 우리를 인도할 것입니다!"
 albania.8.a:0 "출발!"
 albania.9.t:0 "1936년 2월 단식 투쟁"
 albania.9.d:0 "코르처의 노동자들과 장인들이 봉기하여 도시에서 대규모 파업이 일어나고 있습니다. 우리나라의 경제 상황과 자신들의 가난함을 강조하고 있습니다. 시위를 계속 놔둔다면 이 운동이 확산되어 전국가적 혁명이 일어날 수도 있지만, 파업을 무력으로 진압한다면 우리의 이미지와 외교적 관계가 악화할 수도 있습니다."
 albania.9.a:0 "시위를 진압하고 지도자를 체포사세요!"e
 albania.9.b:0 "그냥 놔두죠."
 9_ALB_tt:0 "§R 전국가적 봉기 및 내전을 초래할 가능성이 있습니다!"
 albania.11.t:0 "북부 봉기!"
 albania.11.d:0 "북쪽의 노동자들이 봉기하여 스스로 무장하여, 지역 방위군을 무찌르고 나라 북부를 차지했습니다! 봉기군의 지도자는 뮈슬림 페자로, 상황은 매우 심각합니다. 가만히 놔둘 수는 없습니다."
 albania.11.a:0 "군대, 전투 준비!"
 albania.12.t:0 "이탈리아와의 군사 훈련?"
 albania.12.d:0 "이탈리아 정부는 나폴리에서 합동 군사 훈련을 실시하자고 제안했습니다. 우리 군에 귀중한 훈련 경험을 심어주고, 이탈리아와의 외교 관계를 개선할 수 있을 것입니다."
 albania.12.a:0 "받아들입시다."
 albania.12.b:0 "거절합시다."
 albania.13.t:0 "알바니아의 코민테른 가입 요청"
 albania.13.d:0 "알바니아 노동당의 우리 동무들이 좋은 성과를 냈습니다. 알바니아는 코민테른 가입을 위한 준비가 끝났습니다."
 albania.13.a:0 "들어오라우 동무들!"
 albania.13.b:0 "저들은 아직 준비가 되지 않았습니다."
 albania.14.t:0 "Albania Asks For Guarantee"
 albania.14.d:0 "The Albanian government, anxious to maintain its independence in these troubled times, wished to deepen relations between our two nations by putting in place a defensive treaty that would ensure that Albania's borders are maintained."
 albania.14.a:0 "Albania has our protection"
 albania.14.b:0 "We have no interests in defending Albania"

 ALB_reintegrate_gjirokaster_desc:0 "We have finally liberated our homeland from the vile claws our former overlords! Before we liberated our brethren, Gjirokastër was under the occupation of Greece and has been extremely repressed and artificially integrated into their nation. It will take some time to reverse the effects of their occupation, but it's for the greater good."
