 r56.soviet.1.d:0 "국가 계획 위원회는 현재의 5개년 계획이 여전히 예정보다 앞당겨졌다고 중앙 위원회에 보고하게 되어 기뻐하고 있습니다! 작년 우리는 철강 생산에 큰 진전을 이루었고, 다른 국가들은 그것을 따라오지 못하고 있습니다. 우리는 또한 지난 몇 년 동안 석유와 석탄 생산량을 늘렸습니다.\n국가 계획 위원회는 우리를 산업 강국으로 변모시키고 있습니다! 하지만 우리는 질문이 하나 있습니다. 우리는 여전히 생산 목표를 달성하는데 집중해야 할까요? 아니면 민간 산업을 확대하는 쪽으로 자원을 분배해야 할까요?"
 r56.soviet.1.a:0 "생산 목표에 중점을 맞춰라"

[SOV.GetLeader]는 NKVD 요원들과 함께 스탈린의 사무실로 들어가 러시아 인민들에 대한 범죄를 열거하고 그를 체포했습니다. 재판이 열린 바로 다음날 사형선고를 받고 오후 늦게 교수형을 당했습니다. 또한 스탈린의 범죄에 가담한 혐의로 기소된 러시아 정부의 많은 관리들이 체포되어 수감되거나 처형되고 있습니다.
