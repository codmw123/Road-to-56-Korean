#Events
 
 #People are unhappy
 r56i.event.01.title:0 "Riots in the Streets"
 r56i.event.01.description:0 "It seems the public has been ignored for a bit too long. Angered by the current situation and unable to take anymore, violence has erupted. While their demands are fairly moderate, they are certainly costly."
 r56i.event.01.default:0 "Most disturbing."
 r56i.event.01.democratic:0 "Our citizens are suffering."
 r56i.event.01.communism:0 "Our brothers are being manipulated."
 r56i.event.01.fascism:0 "The people must be given a strong hand."
 
 #People are unhappy again
 r56i.event.02.title:0 "The Riots Return"
 r56i.event.02.description:0 "The riots are still ongoing, and have taken a turn for the worse. More intellectuals from our society are supporting them, and demands originally seen as extreme are being demanded far more often."
 r56i.event.02.default:0 "What can we do?"
 r56i.event.02.democratic:0 "Surely there must be a solution?"
 r56i.event.02.communism:0 "These are not true Communists!"
 r56i.event.02.fascism:0 "Perhaps extreme measures are required."
 
 #Violent suppression is a success
 r56i.event.04.title:0 "Crackdown is a Success"
 r56i.event.04.description:0 "While the discontent may still be hold their beliefs, they've learned the hard way to keep their ideas private. Though unease lingers in the air, the riot and military police have broken up the protests, and the people have returned to their normal lives."
 r56i.event.04.default:0 "A few broken eggs."
 r56i.event.04.democratic:0 "And remember- vote for us!"
 r56i.event.04.communism:0 "The cost of the revolution is high."
 r56i.event.04.fascism:0 "Let the weaklings tremble."
 
 #Violent suppression is a failure
 r56i.event.05.title:0 "Crackdown is a Failure"
 r56i.event.05.description:0 "Though the Military Police we sent at the riots could theoretically restore order, several of our men dispatched to deal with the situation actually started joining the riots. The few who stayed loyal seem to have only angered the rest of the public. It seems we have only added more few to the fire."
 r56i.event.05.default:0 "What do we pay them for?"
 r56i.event.05.democratic:0 "We have betrayed our values for nothing."
 r56i.event.05.communism:0 "They must be getting help from outside."
 r56i.event.05.fascism:0 "We should send the REAL military next time."
 
 #Talk suppression is a success
 r56i.event.06.title:0 "Talks Succeed"
 r56i.event.06.description:0 "Just like any other human, a protest organizer is fallible. Vague, empty promises were enough to placate some of the leaders, while others had to be paid off with... donations for peace efforts from the state treasury. Regardless, with no more organization, the protests seem to have burned themselves out."
 r56i.event.06.default:0 "The pen is mighty."
 r56i.event.06.democratic:0 "Democracy prevails again."
 r56i.event.06.communism:0 "The dialectic serves us well."
 r56i.event.06.fascism:0 "The masses are easily appeased."
 
 #Talk suppresion is a failure
 r56i.event.07.title:0 "Talks Fail"
 r56i.event.07.description:0 "It turns out it's a lot easier to talk one person down than a group- a lesson our Interior Minister has learned after attempting to convince all major protest leaders to disband. With some not believing out promises, and others disgusted by our bribery attempts, we seem to have only sown unity and cohesion between riot leaders."
 r56i.event.07.default:0 "Why can't they be non-aligned, like us?"
 r56i.event.07.democratic:0 "This is an insult to our Democracy."
 r56i.event.07.communism:0 "But our state can provide all!"
 r56i.event.07.fascism:0 "Well, we tried being nice about it."
 
 #Spend suppression is a success
 r56i.event.08.title:0 "Rioters Appeased"
 r56i.event.08.description:0 "Though the cost was high, now that the potholes in our city streets are filled and the social programs have shown a bit of an improvement, the people are happy enough to end the organized riots. Some are still complaining, but most are satisfied."
 r56i.event.08.default:0 "Well, if they're happy..."
 r56i.event.08.democratic:0 "Money makes the world go 'round."
 r56i.event.08.communism:0 "Capital still has some uses."
 r56i.event.08.fascism:0 "The sheep were never a threat."
 
 #Spend suppression is a failure
 r56i.event.09.title:0 "Rioters Demand More"
 r56i.event.09.description:0 "Despite having filled the original demands of the protest leaders, more extreme figures have taken over and have started to demand even more from our state- and the people, now emboldened by perceived victory, are more willing to follow their every word."
 r56i.event.09.default:0 "A waste of valuable funds."
 r56i.event.09.democratic:0 "Spoiled rotten Socialists."
 r56i.event.09.communism:0 "That forced labor was a waste!"
 r56i.event.09.fascism:0 "How DARE they insult our great nation so?"

 #Strikes planners are found out

 strikes_rt56.t:0 "Workers Planning Strikes Arrested"
 strikes_rt56.desc:0 "Government law enforcement has recently uncovered a plan by workers in many factories around the country to strike. Luckily the plan was found out and the ring leaders were arrested. Hopefully this will prevent any production interruptions."
 strikes_rt56.a:0 "We've crack down on the source of this disobedience."

#Event to leave faction in case of revolution
  r56i.event.10.title:0 "A New Diplomatic Orientation?"
  r56i.event.10.description:0 "The establishment of a new government is raising a number of question regarding the future of [ROOT.getnameDef]. [ROOT.GetLeader] is wary of the ideological orientation of the [ROOT.GetFactionName] and fears that such cooperation could lead to a war against countries sympathetic to the [ROOT.GetRulingIdeology] cause and the political orientation of the [ROOT.GetRulingParty]."
  r56i.event.10.a:0 "Those were the allies of the previous government"
  r56i.event.10.b:0 "Respect our diplomatic engagements"


  r56i.event.11.title:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Leaves the [From.GetFactionName]"
  r56i.event.11.description:0 "\nDecided to radically change its diplomatic position, the new [FROM.GetAdjective] [FROM.GetRulingIdeology] government has decided to withdraw from the [FROM.GetFactionName]. The news has stirred upheaval among the member of the [FROM.GetFactionName] as they wonder if other departures may lead to the collapse of their alliance.\n\n [FROM.GetLeader] declared that the necessity to reorient the politics of the country according to the program of the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] motivated his decision, stating that his government will do everything to preserve [From.GetAdjective] independence."
  r56i.event.11.a:0 "The world is changing."

  r56i.event.12.title:0 "A Historic Opportunity"
  r56i.event.12.description:0 "The establishment of our government is raising questions regarding the future of [ROOT.GetName]. For most of us, the answer is clear: it is time to seize our independence. It is clear that our ascension is a clear sign of the rightfulness of the [ROOT.GetRulingIdeology] cause and the we must align our diplomatic situation with the political manifesto of the [ROOT.GetRulingParty]."
  r56i.event.12.a:0 "We are free, at last!"
  r56i.event.12.b:0 "This is too Risky"


  r56i.event.13.title:0 "[From.GetLeader] Declares [From.GetAdjective] Independence"
  r56i.event.13.description:0 "\nThe new [FROM.GetAdjective] [FROM.GetRulingIdeology] government has decided to unilaterally declare its independence. This decision was announced to be total and uncompromising. Therefore [FROM.GetNameDef] will withdraw from all its military obligations and reevaluate its foreign policy. This will certainly anger their former overlord as [FROM.GetLeader] clearly stated that he was not bound by previous treaties and that this day would mark the beginning of a new era in [FROM.GetAdjective] history."
  r56i.event.13.a:0 "Another Revolution."

  r56i.event.14.title:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Rebels!"
  r56i.event.14.description:0 "\nThe [FROM.GetRulingIdeology] takeover has lead to a declaration of [FROM.GetAdjective] independence by [FROM.GetLeader]. Unwilling to respect the established order, their defiant behavior could set a dangerous precedent."
  r56i.event.14.a:0 "We must retaliate!"
  
  r56i.event.15.title:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Dissolves its Faction!"
  r56i.event.15.description:0 "\nUnable to find diplomatic partners, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has announced that it will no longer search to lead an international coalition. They are therefore open to diplomatic openings in order to join a stronger alliance.\n\nThis development will certainly attract the attention of various chancelries. Foreign diplomats are likely already at work in order to sway [FROM.GetLeader] and his government."
  r56i.event.15.a:0 "Interesting."  
  
  r56i.event.16.t:0 "The [alliance_inviter.GetFactionName] and the [alliance_applicant.GetAdjective] Faction Unite into a single alliance!"
  r56i.event.16.d:0 "\n\n World politics is shifting at a rapid pace and therefore the leaders of the [alliance_inviter.GetFactionName] and [alliance_applicant.GetLeader] recognized that it was useless to stand as separate coalitions. Instead, they decided to fight side by side.\nThis will probably worry foreign chancelry as their combined strength may become way more threatening."
  r56i.event.16.a:0 "Interesting."
  r56i.event.16.a:0 "We are stronger together."
  r56i.event.16.b:0 "They seek strength in numbers."
